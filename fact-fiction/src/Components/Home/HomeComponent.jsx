            Did you know that the very design of social media platforms is part
            of the problem? The reward structure of social media itself is a big
            contributor to the spread of fake news- helping fictitious claims
            rise to the top! It's up to us to sharpen our skills since the
            social media giants won't do anything to mitigate the issue.

          <p>
            86% of global internet users have been exposed to fake news. Among
            those users- nearly 90% have thought fake news was real at first- at
            least once. That's a lot going around! And the barrage of fake news
            is only expected to increase as new technologies become mainstream,
            like generative AI. Even worse- people overestimate their ability to
            identify fake news. The worse they are at spotting it, the more
            likely they are to share it!
